# ArduinoMorseCode
Source code for my Arduino-based Morse code translator.

To use, simply change the value of the string variable MESSAGE on line 8.

Uses the [StandardCplusplus](https://github.com/maniacbug/StandardCplusplus) library for additional C++ functionality not included with Arduino's language.
